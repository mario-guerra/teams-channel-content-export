# Microsoft Teams to RAG Knowledge Base Pipeline

## Description

This project is an intelligent data transformation pipeline that converts unstructured Microsoft Teams channel conversations into structured question-answer pairs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced chatbots. The solution automatically extracts institutional knowledge from team communications and transforms it into a searchable, AI-ready knowledge base.

The system addresses the critical challenge faced by organizations where valuable expertise and problem-solving discussions remain trapped in communication platforms, making organizational knowledge difficult to discover and reuse.

## Technologies

### AI/ML Frameworks & APIs
- **Azure OpenAI**: GPT-based language models for question extraction and answer synthesis
- **OpenAI ChatCompletion API**: Advanced prompt engineering for structured data extraction
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Enterprise-grade Teams data access and integration

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3**: Primary development language with async/await capabilities
- **Beautiful Soup 4**: Advanced HTML parsing and content sanitization
- **Requests**: HTTP client for API interactions with retry logic
- **Asyncio**: Asynchronous programming for scalable API processing
- **Regex (re)**: Pattern matching for content cleaning and validation
- **JSON**: Structured data processing and API communication

### Development & Deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management via python-dotenv
- **Argparse**: Professional CLI interface design
- **Date/Time Processing**: Temporal filtering and data organization

## Problem Solved

### Primary Business Challenge
Organizations accumulate massive amounts of valuable knowledge in team communication channels, but this information remains siloed and difficult to leverage. Teams repeatedly ask the same questions, reinvent solutions, and struggle to onboard new members due to scattered institutional knowledge.

### Technical Solution
This pipeline solves the knowledge extraction problem by:

1. **Automated Data Mining**: Systematically extracts conversations from Microsoft Teams channels
2. **Intelligent Content Processing**: Uses AI to identify meaningful question-answer patterns
3. **Knowledge Structuring**: Transforms unstructured discussions into searchable, reusable formats
4. **Scalable Processing**: Handles large volumes of historical data with pagination and rate limiting

## Implementation Details

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Three-Stage Pipeline Design
- **Stage 1 (Data Extraction)**: `channel_query.py` - Focused solely on raw data retrieval
- **Stage 2 (AI Processing)**: Separate scripts for different output formats (JSON/Markdown)
- **Stage 3 (Output Generation)**: Structured files ready for RAG integration

*Rationale*: Separation of concerns allows for independent scaling, testing, and maintenance of each stage.

#### 2. Asynchronous AI Processing
- Implemented async/await pattern for OpenAI API calls
- Concurrent processing reduces total pipeline execution time
- Built-in rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion

*Business Impact*: 3-5x faster processing of large datasets, reducing time-to-deployment for knowledge bases.

#### 3. Robust Error Handling
- Exponential backoff retry logic for API failures
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for production troubleshooting

### Data Processing Approach

#### HTML Content Sanitization
```python
# Converts Teams HTML to clean text while preserving links
soup = BeautifulSoup(message_content, 'html.parser')
for a_tag in soup.find_all('a'):
    if 'href' in a_tag.attrs:
        a_tag.replace_with(f"[{a_tag.text}]({a_tag['href']})")
```

#### Smart Question Extraction
Uses advanced prompt engineering to identify implicit questions in conversational text:
- Removes personal identifiers for privacy compliance
- Extracts core intent from verbose communications
- Handles context-dependent queries

#### Answer Synthesis
Combines multiple reply threads into coherent, comprehensive answers:
- Aggregates knowledge from multiple contributors
- Resolves conflicting information intelligently
- Maintains technical accuracy while improving readability

### Model Selection and Training Process

#### Azure OpenAI Integration
- **Model Choice**: GPT-3.5/4 via Azure's enterprise endpoints
- **Temperature Settings**: Low (0.1) for consistent, factual outputs
- **Token Management**: 4096 token limit optimized for technical content
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom system prompts for domain-specific extraction

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Validation**: JSON schema validation before AI processing
2. **Chunking Strategy**: Optimal content segmentation for token limits
3. **Quality Assurance**: Output validation and format verification
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatic reprocessing for malformed responses

### Deployment Strategy

#### Environment Configuration
- Secure credential management via environment variables
- Separate configurations for development/staging/production
- API key rotation support without code changes

#### Scalability Considerations
- Pagination handling for large Teams channels (10,000+ messages)
- Rate limiting compliance with Microsoft Graph API quotas
- Async processing allows horizontal scaling across multiple instances

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Comprehensive logging for each pipeline stage
- API call tracking and quota monitoring
- Processing metrics for performance optimization
